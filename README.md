# SidebarFolderLogo
Adds a folder logo to the finder sidebar in MacOS. The example is made for a playground folder located in ~/Playground

A new "App" needs to be made for each folder logo. All folders that should be included in the logo are the folders specified in the PlaygroundFolderFinderSync/FinderSync.swift file.
